# The Goal: Name Sorter
Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names.
## Example Usage
Given a a file called unsorted-names-list.txt containing the following list of names;

```Janet Parsons
Vaughn Lewis
Adonis Julius Archer
Shelby Nathan Yoder
Marin Alvarez
London Lindsey
Beau Tristan Bentley
Leo Gardner
Hunter Uriah Mathew Clarke
Mikayla Lopez
Frankie Conner Ritter
```

Executing the program in the following way;
```
name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt
```

Should result the sorted names to screen;
```
Marin Alvarez
Adonis Julius Archer
Beau Tristan Bentley
Hunter Uriah Mathew Clarke
Leo Gardner
Vaughn Lewis
London Lindsey
Mikayla Lopez
Janet Parsons
Frankie Conner Ritter
Shelby Nathan Yoder
``````

and a file in the working directory called `sorted-names-list.txt` containing the sorted names.
## Assessment Criteria
We will execute your submission against a list with a thousand names.

Your submission must meet the following criteria.
- The solution should be available for review on github.
- The names should be sorted correctly.
- It should print the sorted list of names to screen.
- It should write/overwrite the sorted list of names to a file called `sorted-names-list.txt`.
- Unit tests should exist.
- Minimal, practical documentation should exist.
## Awesome, but not essential criteria

Create a build pipeline like Travis or AppVeyor that execute build and test steps.
